# Automated Code Generation and Explanation
An AI-powered application built with LangChain, FastAPI, and Streamlit to generate and explain code snippets on-the-fly. This tool provides an interactive web interface where users can enter natural language prompts to get code and corresponding explanations.

# About The Project
This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the LangChain framework to perform two main tasks: code generation and code explanation. The backend is a high-performance API built with FastAPI, and the user-friendly, interactive frontend is created with Streamlit.

This setup allows for a robust and scalable application, where the AI logic is cleanly separated from the user interface.
# Features
**Interactive UI**: A simple and clean web interface built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

**AI-Powered Logic**: Utilizes the LangChain framework to structure prompts and interact with powerful Large Language Models.

**High-Performance Backend**: Built with FastAPI, ensuring fast, asynchronous API responses.

**Code Generation**: Generate functional code snippets in various programming languages from natural language descriptions.

**Code Explanation**: Get detailed, easy-to-understand explanations for complex code snippets.
